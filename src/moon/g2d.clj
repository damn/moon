; can adjust:
; * split percentage , for higher level areas may scale faster (need to be more careful)
; * not 4 neighbors but just 1 tile randomwalk -> possible to have lvl 9 area next to lvl 1 ?
; * adds metagame to the game , avoid/or fight higher level areas, which areas to go next , etc...
; -> up to the player not step by step level increase like D2
; can not only take first of added-p but multiples also
; can make parameter how fast it scales
; area-level-grid works better with more wide grids
; if the cave is very straight then it is just a continous progression and area-level-grid is useless
(defn area-level-grid
  "Expands from start position by adding one random adjacent neighbor.
  Each random walk is a step and is assigned a level as of max-level.
  Levels are scaled, for example grid has 100 ground cells, so steps would be 0 to 100/99?
  and max-level will smooth it out over 0 to max-level.
  The point of this is to randomize the levels so player does not have a smooth progression
  but can encounter higher level areas randomly around but there is always a path which goes from
  level 0 to max-level, so the player has to decide which areas to do in which order."
